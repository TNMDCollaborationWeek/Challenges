# 2022 challenges  

## :octocat: Theme 1 - What is GitHub?   
There are different code repositories but what sets GitHub apart is its usage in the open source software development world i.e. the data wrangling R package [`dplyr`](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) is hosted on GitHub. 

Create a resource containing information about different public GitHub initiatives created by international statistical or machine learning research organisations. Present your repostiory to address the following questions:  

+ How are statistical or ML research organisations using public GitHub repositories?     
+ Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations?  

## :framed_picture:	Theme 2 - Open datasets   
The Australian government resource [https://data.gov.au/](https://data.gov.au/) contains a rich repository of open datasets, for example [Index of Educational Disadvantage by school - SA government](https://data.gov.au/dataset/ds-sa-4ab8a539-eab5-48e2-8d88-a599d6114126/details?q=education).  

Select one dataset and create a repository to better feature one public dataset. Your repository can host:  

+ Documentation about the dataset metadata. 
+ Dataset summary statistics. 
+ Examples of visualisations created from this dataset.  


## :hammer_and_pick: Theme 3 - Software reproducibility  
Data workflows can be rife with reproducibility challenges i.e. different package dependencies or dataset versions used, lack of a central code repository to store code changes, lack of unit tests or documentation etc.  

Different resources have been developed to help address different reproducibility challenges i.e. [Emily Riederer's blog post on R development tools](https://emilyriederer.netlify.app/post/rmddd-tech-appendix/).  

Select a tool or resource that helps improve code reproducibility practices and create a repository which demonstrates a simple use of this resource. I.e. [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for maintaining R package dependencies. Alternatively, you can also showcase your own functions which help to  streamline data workflows. 

Your repository can host: 
+ Documentation describing the reproducibility issue that your resource (or own functions) address.
+ Code and output examples showcasing how the resource works.  


## :magic_wand: Theme 4 - Elegant Documentation    
[Markdown language](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is incredibly versatile and used for documentation purposes. For example, it is used to create this very document. A guide to markdown syntax can also be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-markdown/).  

Using markdown language as creatively and :sparkle: brightly :sparkle: as possible, create a repository to describe a statistical or qualitative research concept.  

Your repository can host:  
+ Documentation explaining your statistical or qualitative research concept of interest. 
+ Creative ways to communicate how people use or misuse your concept (using memes?).  
+ Links to other resources about your statistical or qualitative research concept of interest.
